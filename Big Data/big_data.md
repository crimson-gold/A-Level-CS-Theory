# Big Data
big data is a term used to describe data sets that are too large and complex to deal with through traditional data-processing
## Volume, Velocity & Variety
big data can be described in terms of
- volume - the amount of data is too big to fit onto a single server / storage device
- velocity - the speed at which the data is created and how fast it moves
- variety - the diversity of data in its format and structure

these factors impact the ease of handling and manipulating the data; larger volumes with more variety and a greater velocity are harder to analyse
## Issues with big data
- relational databases can't be used for big data as theydonâ€™t scale well across multiple servers as they require data to fit into neat rows and columns
- variety makes analysing the data more difficult

to combat these issues techniques like machine learning and functional programming can be used to more efficiently manage big data
