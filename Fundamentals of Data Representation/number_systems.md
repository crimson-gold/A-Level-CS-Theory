# Number Systems

## Number Sets/Types

- Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$)  
all positive integers and 0 such as  
$[0, 1, 64, 9, 88]$. They are used for counting.  
- Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$)  
all negative and positive whole numbers and 0 such as  
$[-4, -1, 0, 32, 275]$
- Rational Numbers/Quotients ($\mathbb{Q}$)  
all numbers that can be expressed exactly as a fraction and 0 such as  
$[3.5, 42, \frac{7}{3}, -27, -\frac{10}{6}]$
- Irrational Numbers (no symbol)  
numbers of which exact values cannot be expressed as a fraction such as  
$[\pi, e, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}]$
- Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)  
all real world quantities; includes all the values above. They are used for
measurement.  
- Ordinal Numbers (no symbol)  
ordinal numbers are integers used to describe the numerical position of objects
in relation to others such as 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and are used in arrays to index
items

## Specification

| Content | Additional information |
| --- | --- |
| Be familiar with the concept of a natural number and the set ℕ of natural numbers (including zero). | ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ... } |
| Be familiar with the concept of an integer and the set ℤ of integers. | ℤ = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } |
| Be familiar with the concept of a rational number and the set ℚ of rational numbers, and that this set includes the integers. | ℚ is the set of numbers that can be written as fractions (ratios of integers). Since a number such as 7 can be written as 7/1, all integers are rational numbers. |
| Be familiar with the concept of an irrational number. | An irrational number is one that cannot be written as a fraction, for example √2 |
| Be familiar with the concept of a real number and the set ℝ of real numbers, which includes the natural numbers, the rational numbers and the irrational numbers. | ℝ is the set of all 'possible real world quantities'. |
| Be familiar with the concept of ordinal numbers and their use to describe the numerical positions of objects | When objects are placed in order, ordinal numbers are used to tell their position. For example, if we have a well-ordered set S = {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’}, then ‘a’ is the 1st object, ‘b’ the 2nd, and so on.
| Be familiar with the use of: <ul><li> natural numbers for counting </li><li> real numbers for measurement</li></ul> |  |
