# Binary Number System

## Specification

| Content | Additional information |
| --- | --- |
| Know the difference between unsigned binary<br>and signed binary. | Students are expected to be able to convert<br>between unsigned binary and decimal and vice<br>versa. |
| Know that in unsigned binary the minimum and<br>maximum values for a given number of bits, n,<br>are 0 and 2n -1 respectively. |  |
| Be able to:<br><ul><li> add two unsigned binary integers<br></li><li> multiply two unsigned binary integers.</li></ul> |  |
| Know that signed binary can be used to<br>represent negative integers and that one<br>possible coding scheme is two’s complement. | This is the only representation of negative<br>integers that will be examined. Students are<br>expected to be able to convert between signed<br>binary and decimal and vice versa. |
| Know how to:<br><ul><li> represent negative and positive integers<br>in two’s complement<br></li><li> perform subtraction using two’s<br>complement<br></li><li> calculate the range of a given number of<br>bits, n.</li></ul> |  |
| Know how numbers with a fractional part can be<br>represented in:<br><ul><li> fixed point form in binary in a given<br>number of bits<br></li><li> floating point form in binary in a given<br>number of bits.</li></ul> | Students are not required to know the Institute<br>of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)<br>standard, only to know, understand and be able<br>to use a simplified floating representation<br>consisting of mantissa + exponent. |
| Be able to convert for each representation from:<br><ul><li> decimal to binary of a given number of<br>bits<br></li><li> binary to decimal of a given number of<br>bits.</li></ul> | Exam questions on floating point numbers will<br>use a format in which both the mantissa and<br>exponent are represented using two's<br>complement |
| Know and be able to explain why both fixed<br>point and floating point representation of<br>decimal numbers may be inaccurate. | Use binary fractions. For a real number to be<br>represented exactly by the binary number<br>system, it must be capable of being represented<br>by a binary fraction in the given number of bits.<br>Some values cannot ever be represented<br>exactly, for example 0.110. |
| Be able to calculate the absolute error of<br>numerical data stored and processed in<br>computer systems. |  |
| Be able to calculate the relative error of<br>numerical data stored and processed in<br>computer systems. |  |
| Compare absolute and relative errors for large<br>and small magnitude numbers, and numbers<br>close to one. |  |
| Compare the advantages and disadvantages of<br>fixed point and floating point forms in terms of<br>range, precision and speed of calculation |  |
| Know why floating point numbers are<br>normalised and be able to normalise un-<br>normalised floating point numbers with positive<br>or negative mantissas. |  |
| Explain underflow and overflow and describe<br>the circumstances in which they occur. |  |
